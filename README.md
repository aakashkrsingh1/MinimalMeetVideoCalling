# Minimal Meet Video Calling

This application utlises the Jitsi Open Source application. We create a basic layout to enter a room name, and with the help of the JitsiMeetConference Options, we create a meeting with that name. 
For utilising Jitsi, we added their Maven Repository, into our build.gradle, sequencially adding their Dependencies and Proguard Rules. For more details, check out their open source repositroy: https://github.com/jitsi/jitsi-meet/blob/master/android/app/proguard-rules.pro . 
We can create our own Video Chat Rooms, and on joining a meeting we can share the link for others to join the meeting, via applicatioin or web-app of Jitsi!
